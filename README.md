# Searsch

This is a very simple search engine written in rust using the [Okapi BM25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25) formula.

I use the noboilerplates scripts to try the search engine.

# TODO:
- [x] A way to save the state of the app.
- [ ] Better UI
- [x] clean up all the unwrap() and expect()
